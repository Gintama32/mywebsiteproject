# mywebsiteproject
this is the copy of the website that I made on webflow. Here I only used HTML and CSS to build the clone of the website so it does not have any back end programming
but only the front-end.
I made it to replace the webflow website but I realized that the back-end is a bit hard so I have not touched the project. The working email backend is only required.
